### Hi there 👋

<!--
**bramyeon/bramyeon** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
Hello, my name is Bryan. I am a senior undergraduate student at [**KAIST**](https://kaist.ac.kr), majoring in [**Electrical Engineering**](https://ee.kaist.ac.kr) with a specially designated major in Artificial Intelligence and a minor in [**Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering**](https://cbe.kaist.ac.kr). I am currently an intern in the [**Data Science Group**](https://ds.ibs.re.kr) at the [**Institute for Basic Science (IBS)**](https://ibs.re.kr).

I am interested in the algorithms and applications (especially in bioinformatics) of machine learning and deep learning (ML/DL), data science, and big data analysis. My current work focuses on the usage of denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) for <i>in-silico</i> protein engineering, specifically antigen-conditioned antibody design. 

Apart from these, I enjoy traveling, taking pictures, watching movies, making hand-drip coffee, singing, and visiting art museums in my free time. I **LOVE** my sugar gliders, check them out [here](https://www.notion.so/Sugar-Gliders-9d58a3da0a5f46ab93b488fc1931af82?pvs=21).
