### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**bramyeon/bramyeon** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
I am an undergraduate student at [**KAIST**](https://kaist.ac.kr), majoring in [**Electrical Engineering**](https://ee.kaist.ac.kr) with a specially designated major in Artificial IntelligenceÂ and a minor in [**Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering**](https://cbe.kaist.ac.kr). I am interested in various areas of artificial intelligence (AI), especially: 
- Generative AI for bioinformatics and computer vision
- Data science
- Large language models (LLMs)

Apart from these, I enjoy traveling, photography, watching movies, making hand-drip coffee, singing, and visiting art museums in my free time. I **LOVE** my sugar gliders, check them out [here](https://bramyeon.notion.site/Sugar-Gliders-9d58a3da0a5f46ab93b488fc1931af82).
